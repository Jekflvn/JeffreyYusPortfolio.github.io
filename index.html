						<h1>Jeffrey Yu's Portfolio<br />
						</h1>
						<p>Hello! My name is Jeffrey Yu and I'm a 2nd year computer engineering student at the 
							University of British Columbia. I'm a passionate, driven individual who enjoys meeting new people and 
							learning new things. In my free time, I like developing projects inspired by my hobbies and interests 
							in my freetime. I'm currently developing an original, magic-themed rogue-lite game inspired by games
							such as Enter the Gungeon. I'm currently looking for any SWE or Computer Engineering co-op 
							opportunities for Summer 2024. I am open to 4,8, and 12 month opportunities. Make sure to check out my <a href="https://github.com/Jekflvn">Github</a>
						and  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-yu-706486251/">Linkedin</a> as well!</p>

									<h2><a href="#">Brightside<br/></a></h2>
									<p> At UBC Solar, our latest project is Brightside, a completely redesigned solar powered race car
										which will be ready for competition for Summer 2024. As a Low Voltage Systems Student Engineer on UBC Solar,
									 I designed numerous pcb's with Altium for board such as the Main Control Board and
									 creating wire harnesses for all electrical connections between components. </p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Jekflvn" class="image fit"><img src="images/gungeon.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Currently Developing a game inspired by enter the gungeon with the unity engine. It will feature all the basic and expected game mechanics such as 
										unlockable items, combat systems, and run-based gamepley while added a twist to the games core mechanics to seperate it from other games. It's currently
										still being developed with all scripts being in C# and assets being handmade or taken from the unity asset store. Stay tuned for more updates! </p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Jekflvn" class="image fit"><img src="images/Platformer" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Pixelman Platformer is a platforming game I developed as practice before creating my dream game. In Pixel Platformer, run and jump your way through multiple, well
										decorated environments full of enemies and reach the goal. I designed everything about the game besides the assets, which were taken from the unity store. 
										This meant creating all the game objects and corresponding scripts for everything. The game features all mechanics to be expected of a platformer such as 
										fluid player movement, collectables, death logic, animations, and a level selector. I still plan to add more environments, mechanics, and levels to the game
										once I finish working on other projects, but you can find the game on my github and try it out.

									<p>I've always been interested in games such as poker and blackjack, so I decided to use this hobby as the inspiration for a project. Using java, I created the 
										popular games roulette, blackjack, and poker along with a betting and buyin system so people can practice playing without actually gambling. For poker, 
										I created a beginner bot to play as well so people can practice playing and learn the rules by themselves. The website for this project is currently down due to some
										technical problems, but it will be fixed soon. I also plan to code an intermediate and advanced level bot for the poker game to give players a big more challenge<p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Jekflvn" class="image fit"><img src="images/hosting-server.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I launched a server to effectively handle concurrent client requests to modify server-side states. It simulates how a client controls a sensor or actuator and how the entity sends data back 
										to a client. While it is simply a simulation for now, the design could theoretically be implemented to work on object in the real world.
										The design employs multi-threaded design to support a high number of requests per second and
										Ensured synchronization safety and utilized thread-safety principles to avoid deadlocks and race conditions.</p>
